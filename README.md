### What I learned

I used figma to measure the distance of certain aspects on the given preview designs. I thelped me alot to match the size.

I learned two things while I did this challenge, one was getting the profile picture to be centered using left, right values and z-index. It was fun to do this but I worry I wasn't the right way to do this. Next thing I learned is that when doing the background images is quite harder than I thought as there is some debate about when to use css background-image or just adding the image. I confirmed that using the background-image is more suitable if there is no semanitic meaning to the background image.

Using the suggestions from frontend mentor broke my Css but I will fix css issues later I just want to have this completed. The suggestion was to change the px amounts on widths to rem or em. However this needs to be done from the beginning. I will work on solidifying my knowledge of working with rem and em instead of px for width on my next project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of because I made the profile was centered</h1>
```
```css
.profile-pic {
  position: absolute;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 4px solid white;
  top: 80px;
  left: 107px;
}
```



### Continued development

Areas that need focus are background-images. 

### Useful resources
